# FirstDataStory
Written in R built a shiny app that mainly purposed for me to gain experience building a dashboard with animations and interactive plots. The app has three tabs, an about me tab, an 'Your Analysis' tab that lets user select a dataset analysis they want to see and my analysis using an Airline Crash dataset pulled from https://opendata.socrata.com/. The app is hosted on SFU shiny app server.
